HFRotationalPanRecognizer
============================

HFRotationalPanRecognizer is a custom UIGestureRecognizer for doing one finger rotations in iOS apps. It tracks the angle of finger movement about a point (defined in the co-ordinate space of the gesture's view's superview). 

By default it excludes/stops tracking a gesture that approaches too close to the rotation origin (default 40pts) or if the gesture leaves the view (pointInside: return NO). 

A velocity is available only at the end of a gesture and it is based only on the last two touches. This met my requirements but yours may differ.  

The rotation angle provided is the total rotation through the current gesture although if you prefer incremental movements (e.g. because you are updating the view transformation) you can set this to zero after reading it. This matches the behaviour of the UIPanGestureRecognizer which keeps the total translation unless reset.

Only single finger touches are processed.

KTOneFingerRotationGestureRecognizer
====================================

KTOneFingerRotationGestureRecognizer is a custom UIGestureRecognizer for doing one finger rotations in iOS apps. It tracks finger movement around a central point.
